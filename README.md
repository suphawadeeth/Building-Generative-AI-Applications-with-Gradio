## Contents:

- Learn how to quickly create and demonstrate machine learning applications.
- Build your own image generation, image captioning, and text summarization apps.
- Share your apps with teammates, beta testers, and more on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Skills:

In this repository, you will gain proficiency in the following areas:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Learn how to leverage pre-trained models like `bart-large-cnn` and `bert-base-NER` for tasks such as text summarization and named entity recognition.
  
- **Generative AI:** Dive into the world of generative AI and explore models like `stable-diffusion-v1-5` for image generation and `blip-image-captioning-base` for image captioning. Understand how to generate realistic images from textual descriptions and vice versa.

- **Image-to-Text Conversion:** Explore techniques for converting images into descriptive text using `blip-image-captioning-base` models.

- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Learn how to generate images from textual descriptions using models like `stable-diffusion-v1-5`. Understand the principles behind text-to-image synthesis and its applications.

- **Chatbot Development:** Discover how to build conversational AI agents using models like `Falcon-40B-Instruct`. Learn how to create interactive chatbot applications that can understand and respond to user queries effectively.
